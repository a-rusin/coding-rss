Hello everyone!

This project was made based on a lesson from Rolling Scopes School - Friday Live Coding!

This layout is fully adaptive and correctly displayed on different devices.

The SASS preprocessor was used in this project.

Also thanks to JS, modal windows (in OOP style), a progress bar for scrolling the page, as well as an "up" button for scrolling to the top of the page were implemented.

In the end, the project was assembled using the Webpack assembler.
